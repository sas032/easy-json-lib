easy-json-lib is a lightweight json library for JAVA to work with JSON type data and interchange formats

## Local Setup

This was started as a hobby project thus it may not support enterprise features which other libariries may support.
The setup is easy as the whole application is written in Java.

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/sas032/EasyRequest.git
```
Now, install eclipse from https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages 
if you do not have that already.
